= ActsAsAmazonProduct

This "acts_as" module makes it extremely simple to add Amazon integration to an 
existing model.  

== Setup

This code does not require changing any current database tables.  It only requires 
adding one migration for a single new table used to cache responses from Amazon.
Run the following to create the migration:

  script/generate acts_as_amazon_product_migration

== Using acts_as_amazon_product

Add the "acts_as" line to your model.  Only :access_key is required.  The :asin and
:name assignments override what attributes in your class should be used for a direct 
lookup (item_lookup) or general search (item_search).  If no value is assigned to :asin 
then a general search is made and the first item (sorted by salesrank) is assigned 
(this functionality will likely change).

There are two ways to use Acts as Amazon Product.  The first is to simply allow all of the Amazon data for your product
to be stored in the AmazonProduct object:

	require 'acts_as_amazon_product'

	class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
	  acts_as_amazon_product :asin => 'isbn', :name => 'title', 
				:access_key => '0123456', :associate_tag => 'assoc-20'
	end
	
Other interesting options for the acts_as_amazon call:

:search_index => 'Books' (default value if not specified)
:response_group => 'Medium' (default value if not specified) 
:auto_load_fields => see below
:ignore_fields => see below

You can now access the Amazon data in your views like so:

	@book = Book.new(:title => 'Getting Things Done')
	@book.amazon.isbn
	@book.amazon.title
	@book.amazon.author
	@book.amazon.small_image_url
	
	or
	@book.amazon.get('itemattributes/foobar')
	
The second way to use Acts as Amazon Product is to load the Amazon data directly into an existing object in your application.
You can elect to have the Amazon data loaded into a new, unsaved object, or go one step further and allow
Acts as Amazon Product to load the data and save the loaded object all in one shot.  The mapping between the 
Amazon fields and your object are declared by passing a hash called auto_load_fields to the acts_as_amazon_product 
call as shown below:
 
 require 'acts_as_amazon_product'
 
 class LocalBook < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_amazon_product(
     :asin => 'isbn', :name => 'title', 
     :access_key => '0123456', :associate_tag => 'assoc-20',
     :auto_load_fields => {:title => 'title', :isbn => 'asin', :publisher_name => 'manufacturer', :author => 'author'}
   ) 
 end
 
The keys in the auto_load_fields hash are the fields in your object, and the values are their Amazon equivalents. 
In the true Rails convention over configuration spirit, we have included some of the most popular auto load fields as 
defaults. If your object contains the following attributes, they will automatically be loaded with their Amazon equivalents:

:auto_load_fields => {:title => 'title', :isbn => 'asin', :publisher_name => 'manufacturer', 
  :author => 'author', :binding => 'binding', :list_price => 'listprice/amount', :pages => 'numberofpages',
  :small_image_url => 'smallimage/url', :medium_image_url => 'mediumimage/url', 
  :large_image_url => 'largeimage/url', :detail_url => 'detailpageurl'}
  
Don't worry if your object does not have some or most of these fields; Acts as Amazon Product is smart enough to check to see 
if the method exists before attempting to load up the Amazon value.  

Now, if by some coincidence you have some fields in your local object that have the same name as our auto_load defaults, you
can choose to specifically ignore those fields using, you guessed it, :ignore_fields.  :ignore_fields is a simple array of 
fields in your object that you do NOT want to be replaced with the Amazon equivalent.  You would specify them like this:

  acts_as_amazon_product(
    :asin => 'isbn', :name => 'title', 
    :access_key => '0123456', :associate_tag => 'assoc-20',
    :ignore_fields => [:small_image_url, :medium_image_url]
  )

In this instance, the object in question would load Amazon info for any of the default fields that the object has, with the 
exception of the small_image_url and medium_image_url values.

To load the Amazon values into your object for local storage, you may call the following methods:

load_from_amazon(title_or_asin, by_title = false)
load_from_amazon!(title_or_asin, by_title = false)

The two methods do exactly the same thing, except the first simply returns a new, unsaved object with its Amazon-like fields
loaded with their appropriate Amazon values.  The second version (load_from_amazon!) goes one step further and saves the 
object for good measure.

You may pass either an isbn (asin) or a title in.  If you are passing a title, you need to specify that you are passing a 
title by also passing true as the second parameter so we will perform an item_search rather than an item_lookup.  Note that 
passing a title is risky business, since currently the code will take the first result returned and load that into your 
object. So unless your title is unique, I would recommend sticking with the isbn (asin) value.  Since that is the default,
all you need to do would be something like this:

@local_book = LocalBook.load_from_amazon('1590598415')

If your object was similar to the LocalBook object in our example, for instance, you would not need to specify the 
auto_load_fields in the acts_as call at all.  The title, isbn, publisher_name and author methods would automatically 
be called once you call load_from_amazon, and their values populated appropriately.

It is important to note that if you call load_from_amazon with an invalid asin, you will simply get back an empty object.

Now, calling load_from_amazon still allows you to take advantage of the other Acts as Amazon features, like the dynamic 
loading of Amazon attributes on the fly by using the various amazon.foo methods as described above.

== Unit tests

There are tests you can run in the [gem]/test directory.  Just create a 
test/config.yml from the example and run "Rake test" from the [gem] directory.
